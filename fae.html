        <p><b>After falling into a new world, Meg learns she is a key to saving it.</b><br> Flouria was a fairytale world that Meg thought she imagined 
            to cope with the realities of her life. She was transported to the world she created after discovering a mysterious tree. Teleporting to 
            another realm is one thing, but coming face to face with a creepy mist and its deadly creatures is another. While fighting for her life, Meg 
            meets others like her—changelings who were brought back to the realm, and they all feel she is the missing Princess who could save the realm. 
            The clues all point to them finding The Lost Land to find the answers they seek on how to fight against the Unseelie's nightmarish horde and 
            save the realm. While the group travels through the realm, the Unseelie King and Queen have learned of her return and are planning her demise. 
            Will they make it in time? Or will the evil mist get a hold of them first?</p>

        <p><b>Six Seelie Guardians. The Unseelie Mist destroys the realm. A race against time.</b><br> Meg and her fellow Guardians now have the ability 
            to restore Flouria to its former glory, or so they hope. With their magic unlocked, they hope to fix what the Unseelie damaged with their 
            destructive Mist. They have a taxing journey ahead of them to the castle, but that only gives them time to master their skills. With true Seelie 
            magic being unleashed back into the world, King Dragus and Queen Maurelle are fighting to maintain their rule. Seelie magic is dying, with the 
            Guardians fighting off the Mist and Unseelie Knights at every turn. Will they be able to get to the Unseelie King and Queen in time before the 
            Seelie magic dies out entirely? They have a long road ahead of them…</p>
