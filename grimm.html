            Eastern Sanction. Only Andreas does not want the bond to be completed right away. He decided that Emira would complete three dates with him, and if 
            things went well, they would complete the bond. After the three dates, everything falls into place. Or so she thought… After he marked her, Emira 
            realized Andreas was not the guy she thought he was. There is a darker side to Andreas… and Emira turns to a Witch to help her escape. Only he haunts

        <p><b>A wolf Turned Vampire. A Vampire Queen who wants her dead. A war to control the sanction.</b><br> Vampires overrun the central Sanction. The wolves 
            no longer control it, and vampires are making humans their slaves. Not to mention their dinner. The Mistress of the Clutch has an unusual taste for 
            Shifters and has taken quite a few of them as her own personal snacks. The Mistress took pity on the young wolf she managed to capture along with a 
            small pack. Instead of sucking her dry, Lumi was spared...and Turned into a Vampire herself. Lumi became strikingly beautiful as she grew older, and 
            the Mistress grew jealous. Sentenced to death, Lumi escapes the Clutch and tries to live as a rogue. As a hybrid, she would never be welcomed inside 
            of a pack. At least, she thought that would be the case. Seven rogue males have formed their own pack and welcome Lumi without a second thought. They 
            help her go through her first shift... and then they realize just how dangerous she is.</p>
