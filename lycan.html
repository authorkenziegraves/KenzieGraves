        <p><b>A fallen kingdom. A resistant bond. Secrets revealed that could be the key to it all.</b><br> Remy returned to the Lycan kingdom expecting 
            a warm welcome. When she discovers that her father is disputing pack lands with her ex-mate, Remy jumps back into pack life to help settle the 
            deal. Word already went around about the Alpha allowing the pack to redo the property lines. Now, the rest are out for blood. As Remy attempts 
            to keep the peace, the Lycans fall back on their old ways. Raid, Ravage, and Reclaim were words of the past that are now what her people cry out 
            as packs dispute the land. Remy is caught between waging wars and runs into the enemy pack. Remy's heart drops when she feels a familiar bond 
            emerge around Myles Damascus, the Alpha of the Death Valley pack. With the Dark Dimension rising and being fated to the Alpha of the pack, who 
            is considered an enemy, Remy has two choices: run back to the island or continue negotiating with the man she is supposed to hate.</p>

            As the game of cat and mouse plays out, Remy is desperate to bring Levi down before he can bring the kingdom down to their knees. Just when she 
            thinks the tides are turning in her favor, a new enemy aligns with Levi. When things look grim, Myles rushes in to save the day. Only Remy isn't so 
            easy to forgive. As Remy wades through battles and mates, she loses her connection to her lycan, rendering her human. Will Remy break the curse to
