        <p><b>A rejected princess. Four outcasted princes. A revenge plot that brings them together.</b><br> In the land of Dragaal, at eighteen, it was 
            expected that every shifter would shift for the first time into their dragon. Only Kaida Hilmir's never emerged. She keeps it a secret, hoping 
            that her dragon will show itself in time. When she is requested to meet Prince Enzo as a possible bride of his choosing, Kaida learns that Enzo 
            is her Fated Mate. As their ceremony is planned, Kaida keeps her dragonless status hidden. Then, the King demands that she show her dragon to 
            everyone. She was rejected in the process and dropped off in the Outcast Lands. As she mends her broken heart, four sexy as-sin Elemental Princes 
            offer her a deal of a lifetime. Help them ascend to the throne, and they will help unlock her dragon. Only they hate her guts, and they don't hide 
            it. Will she survive their training long enough to get her revenge?</p>

        <p><b>Her dragon has emerged. The four princes can't control her. A war brewing between Dragaal and the rejected.</b><br> Kaida is a Plasma Dragon and 
            can't seem to control its power. With her randomly shifting and causing havoc throughout the island, Kaida isn't sure if she is safe around anyone. 
            Beckett, Arlo, and Esen do their best to find the solution to taming her dragon before it kills someone and alerts the king to what kind of dragon 
            she is and how her power is a contender for the throne. The cons of her being a Plasma dragon escalate when Enzo returns to the island to talk to 
            Kaida. Between the Elemental Princes, the Prince of Dragaal's return and possible report back to the king, and her dragon bowing to no oneâ€¦ Kaida 
            isn't sure how she is going to survive. Will Enzo keep her secret? Will the Elemental Princes all come around to be at Kaida's side? Or will the
